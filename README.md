Hello

This is a project that I developed for the DWP hackday in April 2014.

Pibrella is an add on board, made by the teams at Pimoroni and Cyntech.
The board is capable of controlling a number of external inputs and outputs.

The goal of this project is to create a cost effective robot that enables
team members to learn how to work as a team and build a visual representation
of their coding skills.

Enjoy the code :)
